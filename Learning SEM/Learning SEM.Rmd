## Introduction

### Background 
The story is mesopredator release (top down)  versus habitat release (bottom up) for 
red fox, with interactions with lynx and wolves.

![Lynx](www/lynx.jpg)

As the lynx and wolf are hunted out of existence their impact on the red fox declines as predators
As the human populationgrows and industrialisation improves more land is turned arable (seed sown)
the lynx and wold dontlike arable land and decline ~ habitat loss the red fox increases;
they like arable land (mice and thinsg to eat)

* Simple ecology will not work ~ it is not a glm as everything interacts
* We use sem as in the origina paper to identify relatve contribution of each to each
so can we asnwer the question are foxes released from predation or rleased form a carrying capacity

I think that this is an exciting idea for studying as it presses all thebuttons with wolf and lynx 



## Running the SEM
Below I have setup an SEM for you. Run the code, look at the coefficients, and
alter the SEM to remove non-significant components. You should aim to have a
minimal (most simple) SEM where all the coefficients are significant.


```{r sem_code, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 15}
big_sweden.mod<-psem(
  
 # Edit and/or comment out the next 5 lines of code based on coefficients from SEM  
 lme(humans  ~ time   + habitat1,                           random=~1|name,rawd),
 lme(seed    ~ humans + habitat1,                           random=~1|name,rawd),
 lme(wolf    ~ humans + seed + habitat1,                    random=~1|name,rawd),
 lme(lynx    ~ humans + seed + habitat1,                    random=~1|name,rawd),
 lme(red_fox ~ humans + seed + wolf + lynx + habitat1,      random=~1|name, rawd)
 
 )
 
sem_coef(big_sweden.mod)
sem_plot(big_sweden.mod)

```

## Questions

### Interpreting your SEM

Look at your SEM output and answer the following questions (need to get round to
changing them to match the SEM properly!!)

```{r quiz}
quiz(
  question("Which is the most exciting animal?",
    answer("lynx", message = "No, lynx are boring"),
    answer("humans", message = "No, people are boring and I'm antisocial"),
    answer("wolves", correct = TRUE, message = "Yes. Wolves are big and fierce"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("Which type of model is best?",
    answer("SEM", correct = TRUE, message = "SEMs are ace"),
    answer("t.test", message = "Only an idiot would use a t-test on these data"),
    answer("glm", message = "OK, but doesn't account for collinearity or grouping"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```
